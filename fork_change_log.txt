  t_span reduced when not using consecutive TESS sectors.
  Useful when searching data from two sectors that are well separated in time, as number of periods in the period grid are reduced.
  Subtracts maximum difference from t_span

29/07:2025: grid.py
  Added parameter <use_roche_limit> (bool) to period_grid()
  When performing injection-recovery tests, synthetic signals with non-physical orbital periods may be injected.
  Roche limit to be ignored in this case.
  If use_roche_limit == False:
    Ignore roche limit when deciding minimum period (maximum frequency). 
    Minimum frequency currently set to 0.4 days (f_max = 2.8935 * 10**-5
29/07/2025: tls_constants.py
  Added parameter "use_roche_limit" to VALID_PARAMETERS in support of above change.

  Removal of majority of code after line 190 (transitleastsquares.power())
  This code generally related to the calculation of statistics for the best fit transit.
  For injection-recovery tests, these statistics are not necessary. Instead, obtaining basic information about several periodic signals from the power spectrum is required.
  Now identifies up to 10 peaks in the power spectrum using scipy.signal.argrelextrema
    For each peak, only the phasing (T0), transit times, transit duration and transit model are calculated
  transitleastsquares.power() now returns:
    test_statistic_periods,  
    power,
    results_list # (period, power, T0, duration, depth, model_time, model_flux) for each selected peak in the power spectrum.

  Adjusted t_span calculation when not using consecutive TESS sectors.
  Now subtracts all t_differences > 5.0 days from t_span
  Extension of previous change to the case where more than two TESS sectors are used.
